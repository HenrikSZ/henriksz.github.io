      h2
        | Primarily, I am a Computer Science student at the University of Toronto.
        | But beside that, I am contributing to business and security software, websites,
        | and healthcare apps. Behind the scenes, I am getting my hands dirty 
        | with administration for my own services. I also pass on my experience
        | to newcomers to the developer community as a Teaching Assistant for
        | foundational Computer Science courses. Outside of the software community, I help aspiring
        | biologists and chemists present on a website their discoveries in a competition.
